# IntentRecognition
## Steps to build the code
Download the code into a folder

 Enter Command 
* `mkdir build`
*  `cd build`
*  `cmake ..`
*  `make`

Above command should build the Intent Recognition Application along with Gtest

Executables for IntentRecogntion and corresponding Gtest can be found in the below link.

* IntentRecogntion :`build\src\IntentRecogniser_run`
* Gtest: `build\test\IntentRecogniser_tst`

### Note: I have uploaded the built binaries in the folder `build_binaries` for reference.
